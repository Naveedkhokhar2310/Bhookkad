Ingredients For Ker Sangri Achar Recipe:- <br>
200 gm Dry Ker<br>
200 gm Dry Sangri <br>
3 Cups Buttermilk (Chaas) <br>
2 Tablespoons Powdered Rai (Black Mustard Seeds) <br>
1 Teaspoon Dana Methi (Whole Fenugreek Seeds)<br>
2 Teaspoon Split Yellow Mustard (Sarson ke Beej)<br>

1/2 Teaspoon Heeng (Asafoetida)<br>
1 Teaspoon Haldi (Turmeric Powder)<br>
2 Teaspoons Lal Mirch (Red Chilli Powder)<br>
3 Teaspoons Salt<br>
1/2 Cup Mustard Oil<br><br>
Step By Step Instructions for Ker Sangri Achar Recipe- <br><br>
Wash Ker and soak it in Buttermilk for 3 days at room temperature. This helps to remove the bitterness of Ker. You can also use beaten curd mixed with 1 Cup of Water and 2 teaspoons of Salt instead of Buttermilk.<br>

Soak Sangri separately in water overnight starting on the 2nd night.<br>

To process the Ker, drain the buttermilk or curd mixture and wash the Ker 5-6 times with water.<br>

Then add Ker to boiling water and boil for 2 minutes. Then cover with a lid and let it blanch for 5 minutes.<br>

Drain the water from Sangri as well, and boil it separately in new water for 2 minutes. Again leave it covered with a lid for 5 minutes.<br>

Drain the water from both Ker & Sangri. Spread them out on a clean cloth or paper and let them dry completely.<br>

Heat 3 Tablespoons Mustard Oil in a pan and fry the Ker & Sangri in it.<br>

Let the mixture cool down completely.<br>

Now grind the whole spices i.e. Rai (Black Mustard Seeds), Dana Methi (Whole Fenugreek Seeds), Split Yellow Mustard (Sarson ke Beej), Saunf (Fennel Seeds) and Kalonji (Nigella Seeds). Add these to the Ker & Sangri.<br>

Also add Amchur (Dry Mango Powder), Haldi (Turmeric Powder), Red Chilli Powder, Salt and Heeng (Asafoetida) to the mixture.<br>

Mix everything well and transfer the mixture to a jar.<br>

Add the remaining Mustard Oil to the jar. Make sure not to overfill, and leave some space at the top.<br>

Store the pickle at room temperature. Stir with a spoon 2-3 times a day.<br>

Ker Sangri achar will be ready in 8-10 days. Store it at room temperature and serve it along with any Indian meal<br><br>

                        How to Make Masala Dosa:- <br> <br>
‚Ä¢	1.Wash and soak the rice in one container and the dal and fenugreek seeds together in another container for 5-6 hours or over night, depending on the weather.<br>
‚Ä¢	2.Grind dal mixture together to a very smooth consistency. Next grind the rice smooth too and mix the two batters.<br>
‚Ä¢	3.Add salt and enough water to make into a dropping consistency. Leave to ferment over-night or more depending on the weather, till a little spongy.<br>
‚Ä¢	4.If thickened too much, add a little water to thin a bit. Heat tawa, and brush oil over it. When really hot, splash a little water over it, and immediately pour batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion.<br>
‚Ä¢	5.This will have to be very swift and will need a bit of practice.<br>
‚Ä¢	6.After spreading the batter, lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges so that it seeps under the dosa.<br>
‚Ä¢	7.When edges start browning a bit, pass a flat spoon under it to ease the dosa off the pan. Put desired filling in the center, and fold the two edges over.<br>
‚Ä¢	8.Serve accompanied with sambhar and chutney.<br><br>
‚Ä¢	Prepare the masala filling:<br><br>
‚Ä¢	1.Heat the oil in a heavy based pan and add the mustard seeds, then onions, curry leaves and green chillies, and saute over high heat till the onions are a little transparent.<br>
‚Ä¢	2.Add the salt and the turmeric and mix well, before adding the potatoes.<br>
‚Ä¢	3.Turn the potatoes around till well mixed, and add the water, and let it simmer, for 2-3 minutes.<br>

                                            How to make Kashmiri Dahi Baingan Recipe:- <br>
                                            1.	To begin making the Kashmiri Dahi Baingan Recipe, place the cut eggplant/ brinjal pieces in a bowl of salted water for about 10 minutes. <br>
                                            2.	Add 1 tablespoon of mustard oil into a preheated pan. Drain the baingan from its water and add the drained baingan to the pan.<br>
                                            3.	Sprinkle salt after adding the baingan cubes, stir well to combine. Cover and cook the brinjal until soft and roasted. Once done turn off the heat and keep aside. <br>
                                            4.	Into a mixing bowl, add the curd, ginger powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt to taste and whisk well to make a smooth mixture.<br><br>
                                            5.	Now we will make the Kashmiri Dahi Baingan:<br>
                                            6.	In a kadai, heat the rest of the mustard oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the coarsely pounded fennel seeds, green cardamom, asafoetida and saute for a few seconds till the aromas are released.<br> 
                                            7.	Add the whisked curd and give it a brisk boil for 1 minute. Keep whisking to get a smooth dahi mixture. Add the roasted brinjal and boil for another 3-4 minutes and turn off the heat. <br>
                                            8.	Check the salt and adjust according to taste and transfer the Kashmiri Dahi Baingan to a serving bowl.<br>
                                            9.	Serve Kashmiri Dahi Baingan Recipe along with Steamed Rice or Phulka and a side of Kashmiri Style Bharit Marchavangun Recipe-Stuffed Chillies for a simple weekday meal. <br>
